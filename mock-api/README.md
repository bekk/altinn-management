# mock-api

A mock of Altinn, and of Maskinporten, which issues the tokens Altinn's write routes require, for running
altinn-management locally. It keeps its data in memory, so every start begins from the seed in [`resources.json`](src/main/resources/resources.json): Kartverket's three MaskinportenSchema resources in
production, and one of another organisation's.

It copies Altinn's behaviour from Altinn's source code in
[Altinn/altinn-auth](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-auth/tree/main/src/apps/Altinn.ResourceRegistry), not from the
documentation. When you add to it, check the source the same way.

## Running

```sh
./gradlew :mock-api:run   # from the repository root, on http://localhost:8090
```

## Routes

These are the routes of Altinn's Resource Registry it plays. Like in Altinn, anyone may read, and a write needs an Altinn
token from the exchange under [Tokens](#tokens), with the scope `altinn:resourceregistry/resource.write` or
`altinn:resourceregistry/resource.admin`.

| Route | Like in Altinn |
| :-- | :-- |
| `GET /resourceregistry/api/v1/resource/{id}` | The newest version of the resource, or the one in `?versionId=`. The id must match exactly |
| `GET /resourceregistry/api/v1/resource/search` | Filters on `id`, `resourceType`, `orgCode`, `organizationId`, `description`, `keyword` and `reference`, and ignores `title`. `resourceType` is a type's name or number, and any other value is 400. `reference` matches part of any reference, of every type. The filters run over every version, so when only an older version of a resource matches, that older version is returned |
| `POST /resourceregistry/api/v1/resource` | Creates a resource, and answers 201 with a `Location` and no body. First it checks the resource: the identifier, title, description and, when the resource can be delegated, right description in `en`, `nb` and `nn`, the owner's org code, and a `MaskinportenScope` reference. Then it checks that the owner in the body is the token's organisation, and then the scope prefixes. An identifier that is taken is 409 |
| `PUT /resourceregistry/api/v1/resource/{id}` | Adds a new version that replaces the whole resource, and answers 200 with no body. It checks like a POST, but only the owner in the body, not the one the mock has |
| `POST` or `PUT /resourceregistry/api/v1/resource/{id}/policy` | Checks the XACML policy in the multipart field `policyFile`: every rule must be about the resource. It checks the owner the mock has, and answers 201 with no body. The mock does not keep the policy |

Errors look like Altinn's: ProblemDetails sent as `application/json`, or a JSON string. A missing or unknown token gives
401 and a token without access gives 403, both without a body.

A resource is kept the way Altinn keeps it: field names may have any case, unknown fields and nulls are dropped, and an
omitted field gets Altinn's default, like `delegable` and `visible`, which are `true`. A value of the wrong type, or
`null` in a field Altinn cannot leave empty, like `delegable`, is 400. The mock knows the org codes of its seed resources'
owners: `kv` for 971040238 and `slf` for 981544315.

Which check of scope prefixes Altinn runs in production depends on a setting we cannot see. The mock runs Altinn's
default: every Maskinporten scope of the resource must start with the token's `consumer_prefix`, which is `kartverk`,
and a colon, unless the token has the admin scope. Otherwise it answers 401, with a body that lists the scopes under
`InvalidPrefix`.

## Tokens

| Route | Like in Maskinporten and Altinn |
| :-- | :-- |
| `POST /token` | Maskinporten's token endpoint for JWT grants. It checks a grant's claims like Maskinporten does: `aud` must be `http://localhost:8090/`, `iss`, `iat`, `exp` and `scope` must be there, and a grant can only be used once. It does not check the signature, and gives any client the scope it asks for, on behalf of Kartverket, with the scope prefix `kartverk` |
| `GET /authentication/api/v1/exchange/maskinporten` | Altinn's exchange of a Maskinporten token for an Altinn token. The Altinn token lasts 30 minutes and has the Maskinporten token's claims, `scope` and `consumer` among them |

The mock's tokens are JWTs without a signature. Instead, the mock only accepts a token it issued itself.
